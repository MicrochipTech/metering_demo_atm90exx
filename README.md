## 1. Introduction<a name="step1">  

This application example assists in the development of a project utilizing ATM90Exx devices.

ATM90Exx devices are used on AC electrical metering/measuring applications.

This example is based on the "Metering Demo Application" of Harmony3 "smartenergy_metrology" repository (see more information on <a href="https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/smartenergy_metrology" target="_blank">https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/smartenergy_metrology</a>), where some changes have to been done to adapt the application files to the platform.

The SAMD20-EK serves as a host device, collecting metrology and measurement data from the ATM90Exx DBs. The connection can be established via Serial Port or SPI when the ATM90E26-DB is connected, or through SPI for the ATM90E3xx-DB.

An OLED1_XPLAINED_PRO EK is used to display the information, switch between display windows, and notify events.

To provide the storage capabilities for saving the files defined in the application is used:

- ATM90E26: Internal NVM
- ATM90E32: SPI EEPROM (EEPROM-4 Click)
- ATM90E36: MICROSD (IO1 Xplained Pro)

The SAMD20-EK USB connector is used to interface with the Command Line and Console applications.

## 2.Application review<a name="step2">  

The approach involves replicating the functionalities of the **_SmartEnergy Metrology Driver_** (for more information, visit **_https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/smartenergy_metrology_**). This is achieved by developing software for the ATM90EXX Controller with similar library interfaces and functionalities. Consequently, only minimal changes to the application files are required to adapt the Demometer Application to the new platform.

### ATM90EXX Metrology Controller

The ATM90EXX Metrology Controller has been developped in different layers and files.

![ATM90EXX Metrology Controller](docs/ATM90EXX_CTRL_Layers.png)

#### ATM90EXX_HAL  

Defines the API interfaces necessary to access physically to ATM90EXX.
 - SPI/Serial access based on Harmony 3 SPI/USART Driver in synchronous mode 
 - Interrupts based on PLIB EIC 
 - Integration period Timer based on SYS TIME
 - PIO control based on PLIB PORT

Defined on atm90exx_hal.[c,h]. 

#### ATM90EXX_CTRL  

Provides an API interfaces similar to Smart Energy Metrology Driver to simplify the adaptation to metrology application.

Includes these features:
 - ATM90EXX Driver Management - Init/Open/Close/Start/Stop
 - ATM90EXX Configuration Capabilities (Task)
 - ATM90EXX Interrupts Handling and Notification of Events 
 - ATM90EXX Direct Register Read/Write
 - ATM90EXX Refresh Measurement/Metering Information (Task) 
 - Integration Period Notification to the application

Defined on atm90exx_drv.[c,h].

#### ATM90EXX_API  

Provides an API interface to:
 - Get ATM90EXX measurement/metrology information
 - Get/Set ATM90EXX configuration
 - Get ATM90EXX registers information

Defined on atm90exx_api.[c,h].

#### ATM90EXX_API_EVENTS  

Provides an API interface to:
- Enable/Disable ATM90EXX metrology events
- Configure thresholds that control metrology events
- Get metrology events through a callback

Defined on atm90exx_api_events.[c,h].

- atm90exx_defs.h:
	- ATM90EXX definitions

#### Typical Flow using ATM90EXX Metrology Controller   

![Typical flow using ATM90EXX Metrology Controller](docs/MetrologyDriverTypicalFlow.png)

#### METROLOGY Library Abstraction Layer  

An additional abstraction layer has been introduced to unify the API interface from the perspective of applications when interfacing with different metrology implementations.

 - metrology_conf.h
	- configures the metrology capabilities.
 - metrology_api.[c,h]
	- Provides an API interface to: 
		- Management of metrology driver (open, close, ...)
		- Integration Period event callback

### Applications  

This example is based on the "Metering Demo Application" from the Harmony3 "smartenergy_metrology" repository. For more information, please visit https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/smartenergy_metrology. Some modifications have been made to adapt the application files to the platform..

It is recommended to review the "Metering Demo Application" documentation beforehand to understand the functionality of the application.

![Application Schema](docs/ApplicationSchema.png)
 
### METROLOGY Application adaptation  

The Demo Meter Metrology application has been updated to utilize the previously defined Metrology API. The application configures the metrology controller based on the ATM90EXX to obtain and refresh metrology and measurement parameters at each integration period (default is 5 seconds). This process is visually indicated by the toggling of the SAMD20-EK LED0 with each refresh. This event triggers the reading of energy and power, updating the information regarding energy demand, time-of-use (TOU), and events.

### DISPLAY Application adaptation  

The Demo Meter application has been updated to address the OLED1 XPLAINED PRO display (128x32 pixels).  

The Microchip "gfx_mono" library has been used to provide support to the Display functionalities defining the corresponding GFX_MONO_UG_2832HSWEG04.

The interface configuration to address the SSD1306 SPI controller that controls the LCD Display is defined on **gfx_definitions.h**

An additional abstraction layer has been included to provide the functions required by the application to display the different informations:

 - oled1_display.[c,h]

The sysfont selected is BPMONO_10x16 providing a full map of 2x16 characters.

The distribution of the information addresses:
 - Parameter String
 - Parameter Value
 - Event Notification - Not used
 - Parameter Value Units

![DISPLAY Information Distribution](docs/DISPLAY_Info_disposition.png)

Buttons:
 - Button 1 and 2 act like SCROLL_UP and SCROLL_DOWN.
 - Button 3 is not used but it's planned to implement TAMPER feature.

Leds:
 - LED1 updates with each serial port communication
 - LED2 and 3 are not used 

### DATALOG Application adaptation  

The application continues to utilize the Harmony3 DRV_MEMORY and FILESYSTEM configuration. Different options are evaluated depending on the platform:
- Internal NVM (ATM90E26)
- EEPROM SPI (ATM90E32)
- SDCard SPI (ATM90E36)

The filename for the metrology configuration has been updated to use the specific device name instead of "metrology" to prevent issues when addressing different ATM90EXX devices using the same hardware setup. 

## ENERGY Application adaptation  

The SUPC and Tamper event detection features are currently unavailable. Additionally, the process for detecting minute and month changes has been adjusted to align with the capabilities of the SAMD20 RTC.

## EVENTS Application adaptation  

New events have been defined according to the detection capabilities of the ATM90EXX within the specified structure, but they are not yet handled by the application.

## CONSOLE Application adaptation  

Most of the commands are available with the same parameters. The register information for the ATM90EXX has been organized to mirror the structure of the "SmartEnergy Metrology Driver" (control, status, and accumulator registers).

Additional Commands:
 - System (SYS): allows to configure the System Log Level. Helps in the development/debug process.

### OTHER Adaptations  


### Additional features pending to implement  

 - [ ] Support for common format for measurement/metering parameters
 - [ ] Support for Set Configuration Registers (DCW, DCM command line)

The external 32.765Khz XTAL is used as reference for RTC peripheral and internal 8Mhz oscillator is used for the rest of the system.  

![MCC Peripheral Clock Configuration](docs/ATM90EXX_MCC_PeripheralClock_Configuration.png)

**Step 5** - RTC Configuration  

The RTC configuration is common to all projects. The peripheral is configured in Clock/Calendar mode.

![MCC RTC Configuration](docs/ATM90EXX_MCC_RTC_Configuration.png)

**Step 6** - Time System Configuration  

The system time is used working with the TC0. A 1mseg resolution is enough to implement the delays and timings on that application.

![MCC Time Configuration](docs/ATM90EXX_MCC_Time_Configuration.png)

![MCC TC0 Configuration](docs/ATM90EXX_MCC_TC0_Configuration.png)

**Step 7** - System Console, Commands and Debug Configuration  

System Console, command line and debug system use the same SERCOM configured as serial port that is accesible on the SAMD20-EK USB Connector.
